**API:**

-- Employee two Airtable's. One will handle the Posts of Users while the second will handle the Comments from other Users as it relates to      the individual Posts. This will in effect create a 'Forum' style approach to the overall App.

  **SWOT Analysis:**
  
  Strengths:
  
  -- Styling, Rendering Components, & Axios.
  
  Weaknesses: 
  
  -- JavaScript Methods.
  
  Oppurtunities: 
  
  -- Be able to employ use of React Router as well as test my overall understanding of React and Javascript Methods. 
  
  Threats: 
  
   -- Utilizing and connecting two different Airtables to be able to create both Posts and Comments. With this as well as my Post MVP               goals I hope to practice and solidify my understanding of JavaScript Methods as well as go deeper into Rendering components and               RESTful API's with Airtable.
